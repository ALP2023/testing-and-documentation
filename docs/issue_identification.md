The following is a documentation of bugs identified.

1. Not PEP8 naming standard:
def _check_rows(board, player):
def _check_columns(board, player):
def _check_diagonals(board, player):

2. There's no input validation - input errors raise an exception

user input = 0

problematic code
def main():
    while moves < 9:
        row, col = map(int, input(f"Player {current_player}, enter row and column (0-2) separated by space: ").split())

Error raised:
__exception__ = {tuple: 3} (<class 'ValueError'>, ValueError('not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)'), <traceback object at 0x000002C3DE8A70C0>)
 0 = {type} <class 'ValueError'>
 1 = {ValueError} not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
 2 = {traceback} <traceback object at 0x000002C3DE8A70C0>
 __len__ = {int} 3
board = {list: 3} [[' ', ' ', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' ']]
current_player = {str} 'X'
moves = {int} 0
results = {list: 0} []

3. _check_diagonals() function  doesn't actually check is responsible for verifying if a player ('X' or 'O') has won the game by forming a diagonal line of their symbols on the game board. However, there's an error in the code, and needs refactoring.
NB: a test_is_win_identifies_diagonal_win() function (provided) fails, suggesting that there is an issue with the _check_diagonals() function. This function should return a True if any player wins any diagonal, else returns a False. Requires debugging and possibly refactoring.
This test checks diagonals for win condition for a given player. with the following arguments...

board(list): List of a list to define a 3x3 grid to represent game board
player(str): Checks for a win for player 'X' or 'O'
It then returns a bool: True if any player wins any diagonal, else False.
The issue with the code is how the diagonal checks are implemented. In this instance, the checks are hard-coded to check specific positions on the game board, but these positions are incorrect (i.e. not checking diagonal from origin 0,0).
